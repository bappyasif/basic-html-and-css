    <h1>Just Flexbox!!</h1>
    <!-- Flexbox is a way to arrange items into rows or columns, where those items will flex (i.e. grow or shrink) based on some simple rules that you can define -->
    <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="one"></div>
        <div class="two"></div>
        <div class="three"></div>
        <div class="four"></div>
    </div>
    <!-- 
        > A flex container is any element that has display: flex on it. A flex item is any element that lives directly inside of a flex container 
        > you can also put display: flex on a flex item, and then use flexbox to arrange its children
    -->

    <!-- 
        GROWING AND SHRINKING

        Flex shorthand:
        > The flex declaration is actually a shorthand for 3 properties that you can set on a flex item
        > These properties affect how flex items size themselves within their container
        > Shorthand properties are CSS properties that let you set the values of multiple other CSS properties simultaneously
        > Using a shorthand property, you can write more concise (and often more readable) stylesheets, saving time and energy

        In this case, flex is actually a shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis
        The default value of the flex property is flex-grow: 0, flex-shrink: 1, flex-basis: 0%

        flex-grow:
        > flex-grow expects a single number as its value, and that number is used as the flex-item’s “growth factor”
        > When we applied flex: 1 to every div inside our container, we were telling every div to grow the same amount
        > If we instead add flex: 2 to just one of the divs, then that div would grow to 2x the size of the others

        flex-shrink:
        > flex-shrink is similar to flex-grow, but sets the “shrink factor” of a flex item
        > flex-shrink only ends up being applied if the size of all flex items is larger than their parent container
        > The default shrink factor is flex-shrink: 1, which means all items will shrink evenly
        > If you do not want an item to shrink then you can specify flex-shrink: 0;
        > You can also specify higher numbers to make certain items shrink at a higher rate than normal
        
        An important implication to notice here is that when you specify flex-grow or flex-shrink, flex items do not necessarily respect your given values for width
        when their parent is big enough, they grow to fill it. Likewise, when the parent is too small, the default behavior is for them to shrink to fit

        flex-basis:
        > flex-basis simply sets the initial size of a flex item, so any sort of flex-growing or flex-shrinking starts from that baseline size
        > The shorthand value defaults to flex-basis: 0%
        > The reason we had to change it to auto in the flex-shrink example is that with the basis set to 0, those items would ignore the item’s width, and everything would shrink evenly
        > Using auto as a flex-basis tells the item to check for a width declaration

        There is a difference between the default value of flex-basis and the way the flex shorthand defines it if no flex-basis is given
        The actual default value for flex-basis is auto, but when you specify flex: 1 on an element, it interprets that as flex: 1 1 0
        If you want to only adjust an item’s flex-grow you can simply do so directly, without the shorthand, or you can be more verbose and use the full 3 value shorthand flex: 1 1 auto
        You could also use the predefined value flex: auto, which is equivalent to flex: 1 1 auto

        In practice…:
        > In practice you will likely not be using complex values for flex-grow, flex-shrink or flex-basis
        > Generally, you’re most likely to use declarations like flex: 1; to make divs grow evenly and flex-shrink: 0 to keep certain divs from shrinking
     -->

    <!-- 
        AXES
        > flexbox can work either horizontally or vertically, and the way some rules work changes a bit depending on which direction you are working with
        > The default direction for a flex container is horizontal, or row, but you can change the direction to vertical, or column

        No matter which direction you’re using, you need to think of your flex-containers as having 2 axes: the main axis and the cross axis
        It is the direction of these axes that changes when the flex-direction is changed

        One thing to note is that in this example, flex-direction: column would not work as expected if we used the shorthand flex: 1 instead of flex: 1 1 auto
        The divs collapse, even though they clearly have a height defined there
        The reason for this is that the flex shorthand expands flex-basis to 0, which means that all flex-growing and flex-shrinking would begin their calculations from 0
        when we changed the flex-direction to column, flex-basis refers to height instead of width
