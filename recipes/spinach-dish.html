    <h1>Spinach Dish</h1>
    <img src="../images/spinach-dish.webp" alt="spinach dish">
    <p>This is a quick and flavorful way to prepare spinach during a busy weeknight. It goes great with a homestyle meal
        or when making something lite and healthy. Regular butter or whole milk can be substituted. I use whipped butter
        and low-fat milk to reduce saturated fat. </p>
    <p>Fresh spinach may be used, although I recommend frozen, but will need to be boiled until tender, finely chopped,
        and dried very well. Double the sauce ingredients to make a slightly creamy texture. Recipe makes 2 regular or 3
        small servings. Hope you like it.</p>
