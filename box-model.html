        Block and inline boxes: broadly two types of boxes, namely block and inline boxes
        > These characteristics refer to how the box behaves in terms of page flow and in relation to other boxes on the page
        > Boxes also have an inner display type and an outer display type

        If a box has an outer display type of block, it will behave in the following ways:
            > box will break into a new line
            > box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available in its container
            > width and height properties are respected
            > Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box
        Some HTML elements, such as <h1> and <p>, use block as their outer display type by default
        
        If a box has an outer display type of inline, then:
            > box will not break onto a new line
            > width and height properties will not apply
            > vertical padding, margins, and borders will apply but will not cause other inline boxes to move away from the box
            > horizontal padding, margins, and borders will apply and will cause other inline boxes to move away from the box
        Some HTML elements, such as <a>, <span>, <em> and <strong> use inline as their outer display type by default.
        
        The type of box applied to an element is defined by display property values such as block and inline, and relates to the outer value of display

        Inner and outer display types: 
            > which dictates how elements inside that box are laid out in normal flow
            > which means that they behave just like any other block and inline elements
        
        We can, however, change the inner display type by using display values like flex
        If we set display: flex; on an element, the outer display type is block, but the inner display type is changed to flex
        Block and inline layout is sometimes referred to as normal flow
